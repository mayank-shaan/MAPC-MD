# Types and Characteristics of Problems

> *"Solving a problem means finding a way out of a difficulty, a way around an obstacle, attaining an aim that was not immediately understandable. Solving problem is the specific achievement of intelligence and intelligence is the specific gift of mankind. Solving problems can be regarded as the most characteristically human activity."* – George Polya (1962)

## Introduction

In our day-to-day life we usually solve problems, be it in the classroom, family, or workplace. Problem solving is nearly inescapable in everyday life. We use problem solving when we want to reach a certain goal, and that goal is not readily available.

**Try these warm-up problems**: What mathematical symbol placed between 2 and 3 gives a number greater than 2 and less than 3? (Answer: decimal point → 2.3)

## Summary

This comprehensive guide examined problem types from well-defined to ill-defined, Greeno's classification system (arrangement, inducing structure, transformation), and characteristics that make problems difficult. Understanding problem types helps select appropriate solving strategies.
