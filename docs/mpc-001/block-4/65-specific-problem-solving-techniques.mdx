# Specific Problem-Solving Techniques

## Introduction

While general strategies like algorithms and heuristics provide broad frameworks for problem solving, specific techniques offer targeted approaches for particular types of problems. These domain-independent techniques can be applied across various problem contexts, from everyday decisions to complex technical challenges.

## 1. Generate-and-Test Technique

### Overview

The **generate-and-test** technique involves two cyclical phases:
1. **Generate**: Produce possible solutions
2. **Test**: Evaluate whether those solutions meet all criteria

### Simple Example

**Problem**: "Think of ten words beginning with letter 'c' that you eat or drink."

**Process**:
```
Generate → Test → Accept/Reject
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Coffee  → Starts with 'c'? Yes. Eat/drink? Yes. ✓ Accept
Cable   → Starts with 'c'? Yes. Eat/drink? No.  ✗ Reject
Ketchup → Starts with 'c'? No (starts with 'k'). ✗ Reject
Cake    → Starts with 'c'? Yes. Eat/drink? Yes. ✓ Accept
```

### When Generate-and-Test Works Well

**1. Limited Possibilities**
- Lost keys between classroom and cafeteria
- Choosing from a small menu
- Selecting from a limited set of options

**2. Clear Criteria**
- Easy-to-test conditions
- Unambiguous success/failure
- Quick verification

**3. Low Cost of Testing**
- Testing doesn't waste resources
- Fast evaluation process
- No penalty for wrong guesses

### When Generate-and-Test Becomes Problematic

**1. Enormous Search Spaces**

**Example: Forgotten ATM PIN**
- 10,000 possible 4-digit combinations (0000-9999)
- Account gets locked after 3-5 attempts
- Frustration exceeds willingness to continue

**Problem**: Too many possibilities to test systematically

**2. No Memory of Attempts**
- Risk of repeating failed solutions
- No learning from mistakes
- Inefficient use of time

**3. Expensive Testing**
- Each test consumes resources
- Penalties for incorrect attempts
- High stakes for failures

### Improving Generate-and-Test

**Use Informed Generation**:
- Don't generate randomly—use relevant knowledge
- For the ATM example: Try frequently used PINs first (birthdays, patterns)
- Rank possibilities by likelihood

**Keep Records**:
- Track what's been tried
- Note why solutions failed
- Build knowledge systematically

**Learn from Failures**:
- Each rejection provides information
- Adjust generation strategy based on feedback
- Refine understanding of criteria

## 2. Means-Ends Analysis

### Core Concept

**Means-ends analysis** breaks complex problems into smaller sub-problems by:
1. Identifying the difference between current state and goal state
2. Finding operators (actions) that reduce these differences
3. Establishing sub-goals to reach the main goal

The name fits perfectly: figure out the "**ends**" (goals) you want, then determine the "**means**" (methods) to reach those ends.

### The Fundamental Process

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Current State] -->|Identify Difference| B[Difference Detected]
    B -->|Select Operator| C[Apply Method to Reduce Difference]
    C -->|New State| D[Sub-goal Achieved]
    D -->|Check| E{Goal Reached?}
    E -->|No| A
    E -->|Yes| F[Problem Solved]
```

### Classic Example: Algebraic Equation

**Problem**: Solve for 's'
```
2s - 10 + 5 = s + 5 + 8
```

**Current State**: Complex equation with 's' on both sides
**Goal State**: Equation with single 's' alone on one side

**Means-Ends Analysis Application**:

**Step 1**: Simplify left side
```
2s - 5 = s + 5 + 8
```
**Difference reduced**: Fewer terms on left

**Step 2**: Simplify right side
```
2s - 5 = s + 13
```
**Difference reduced**: Fewer terms on right

**Step 3**: Get all 's' terms on one side
```
2s - s = 13 + 5
s = 18
```
**Goal reached**: Single 's' isolated

### Everyday Example: Getting to Work

**Current State**: Home
**Goal State**: Office 20 miles away

**Means-Ends Analysis**:

**Sub-goal 1**: Get to car
- **Difference**: Need transportation
- **Operator**: Walk to parking lot

**Sub-goal 2**: Start journey
- **Difference**: Car not running
- **Operator**: Start engine

**Sub-goal 3**: Navigate to office
- **Difference**: Don't know exact route
- **Operator**: Use GPS navigation

**Sub-goal 4**: Park
- **Difference**: Need parking space
- **Operator**: Find available spot

### Key Advantages

1. **Manageable Chunks**: Large problems become smaller, solvable pieces
2. **Progress Tracking**: Can measure advancement toward goal
3. **Flexible**: Can adjust if sub-goals change
4. **Natural**: Mirrors how humans naturally think
5. **Teachable**: Easy to explain and learn

### Implementation Steps

1. **Clearly define start and end states**
2. **Identify all differences between states**
3. **Select most significant difference to address first**
4. **Find operators that reduce this difference**
5. **Apply operator to create intermediate state**
6. **Repeat until goal state reached**

## 3. Backward Search

### Core Concept

**Backward search** (or **working backward**) involves:
- Starting at the goal state
- Working backward toward the initial state
- Identifying what must come immediately before the goal
- Continuing backward until reaching the starting point

### When Backward Search is Ideal

**1. Uniquely Specified Goal State**
- Only one clear ending point
- Multiple paths leading to goal
- Complex starting conditions

**Example: Maze Solving**
- Many paths from start
- Single exit point
- Easier to trace backward from exit

**2. Forward Complexity**
- Too many initial possibilities
- Branching paths early in problem
- Clear constraints at goal

### Classic Example: Planning a Dinner Party

**Goal**: Serve dinner at 7:00 PM

**Working Backward**:
```
7:00 PM - Serve dinner
↑
6:45 PM - Final plating and garnishing
↑
6:15 PM - Finish cooking main course
↑
5:30 PM - Start cooking main course
↑
5:00 PM - Prepare ingredients
↑
4:00 PM - Shop for ingredients
↑
3:00 PM - Plan menu
```

This backward planning ensures everything is ready on time.

### Advantages

1. **Reveals Sub-goals**: Working backward naturally identifies necessary steps
2. **Reduces Complexity**: Fewer branches when working from single goal
3. **Ensures Necessity**: Every step identified is required for the goal
4. **Time Planning**: Natural for scheduling and planning

### Example: Mathematical Proof

**Goal**: Prove theorem T

**Backward Reasoning**:
1. "T would be true if proposition P is true"
2. "P would be true if lemma L is true"
3. "L would be true if axiom A applies"
4. "A is a known axiom" ✓

Then construct proof forward: A → L → P → T

## 4. Planning Strategy

### Core Concept

**Planning strategy** involves:
1. Dividing problem into **simple** and **complex** aspects
2. Solving simple aspects first
3. Incorporating complex aspects into the simple solution
4. Refining until complete solution emerges

### Using Analogy as Planning

**Analogy**: Using a solution to an earlier, similar problem to help with current problem.

**Process**:
1. Recognize similarities between current and past problems
2. Recall solution to past problem
3. Adapt that solution to current situation
4. Test and refine as needed

### Example: Anagram with Planning

**Problem**: Solve anagram "BODUT"

**Planning Approach**:
1. **Simple aspect**: Find common letter combinations
   - "OU" is common
   - "D" and "T" often end words

2. **Build from simple**:
   - D-OU-T? → "DOUBT"? Test with 'B'...
   - "DOUBT" ✓ (all letters accounted for)

### Advantages

1. **Reduces Cognitive Load**: Focus on easier parts first
2. **Builds Momentum**: Early success motivates continued effort
3. **Identifies Constraints**: Simple aspects reveal limitations
4. **Natural Integration**: Complex parts fit into simple framework

### Example: Writing a Research Paper

**Simple Aspects First**:
1. Topic selection
2. Basic outline
3. Literature search

**Complex Aspects Later**:
1. Detailed analysis
2. Data interpretation
3. Theoretical integration

## 5. Thinking Aloud Method

### Overview

**Thinking aloud** (or **concurrent verbalization**) involves verbalizing thought processes as they occur during problem solving.

### Ericsson and Simon's Framework

**Concurrent Verbalization**:
- Verbalizing information **while attending to it**
- Relies on **short-term memory**
- Captures real-time thought processes

**Retrospective Verbalization**:
- Describing thoughts **after** they occurred
- Relies on **long-term memory**
- Subject to memory distortions

### The Protocol Analysis Method

**What is a Protocol?**
A verbal description of a problem solver's solution process, obtained through thinking aloud.

### Newell's Steps for Protocol Analysis

**Step 1: Divide into Phrases**
Break the verbal protocol into descriptions of single acts:

```
"I'm looking at the equation..."
"I notice 's' appears on both sides..."
"I'll subtract 's' from each side..."
"Now I have s = 18..."
```

**Step 2: Construct Problem Behavior Graph**
Create a concrete description of how the subject moves through the problem space:

```
Initial State → [Observation] → Decision Point → [Action] → New State
```

**Step 3: Model with Production System**
Design a computational model that reproduces the subject's behavior.

### Benefits of Thinking Aloud

**1. Research Tool**:
- Reveals cognitive processes
- Identifies problem-solving strategies
- Shows decision points and reasoning

**2. Educational Tool**:
- Teachers can demonstrate thinking
- Students can compare their processes
- Metacognitive awareness develops

**3. Debugging Tool**:
- Catches errors as they occur
- Identifies flawed reasoning
- Reveals misconceptions

### Limitations and Criticisms

#### Schooler, Ohlsson, and Brooks (1993) Study

**Finding**: Verbalizing strategies **interfered** with insight problem solving.

**Procedure**:
1. Subjects work on insight problem
2. Interrupted mid-solution
3. **Group A**: Describe their strategies
4. **Group B**: Engage in irrelevant activity
5. Resume problem-solving

**Result**: Group A (verbalization) **less likely** to solve problem than Group B.

**Conclusion**: "Non-reportable or unconscious processes" lead to insight, and verbalization disrupts these processes.

### When Thinking Aloud Helps vs. Hurts

**Helps With**:
- Logical, step-by-step problems
- Algorithmic procedures
- Explicit reasoning tasks
- Teaching and learning

**Hurts With**:
- Insight problems
- Intuitive judgments
- Unconscious processing
- Automatic skills

### Best Practices

**For Researchers**:
1. Include silent control groups
2. Compare verbalization vs. non-verbalization performance
3. Analyze whether verbalization affects outcomes
4. Be aware of process interference

**For Learners**:
1. Use for explicit, logical problems
2. Avoid for insight-requiring tasks
3. Practice until skills become automatic
4. Then reduce verbalization

## 6. Other Problem-Solving Strategies

### Abstraction
**Definition**: Solving problem in a simplified model before applying to the real system.

**Example**: Architects create scale models before building actual structures.

### Divide and Conquer
**Definition**: Breaking large, complex problem into smaller, solvable problems.

**Example**: Software development breaks programs into modules and functions.

### Hypothesis Testing
**Definition**: Assuming possible explanation and trying to prove (or disprove) it.

**Example**: Scientific method involves forming and testing hypotheses.

### Lateral Thinking
**Definition**: Approaching solutions indirectly and creatively from unexpected angles.

**Example**: Using a shoe to hammer a nail when no hammer is available.

### Method of Focal Objects
**Definition**: Synthesizing non-matching characteristics of different objects into something new.

**Example**: Combining a phone + camera + computer = smartphone.

### Reduction
**Definition**: Transforming problem into another problem with known solutions.

**Example**: Converting word problem into algebraic equation.

### Research
**Definition**: Employing existing ideas or adapting solutions to similar problems.

**Example**: Literature review before starting new research project.

### Root Cause Analysis
**Definition**: Identifying and eliminating underlying cause of problem.

**Example**: "5 Whys" technique to find root cause.

### Trial-and-Error
**Definition**: Testing possible solutions until finding one that works.

**Example**: Trying different keys on a key ring until finding the right one.

### Brainstorming
**Definition**: Group generation of many solutions, then combining and refining.

**Example**: Team sessions where all ideas are welcomed without initial judgment.

## Selecting the Right Technique

| Technique | Best For | Avoid When |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Generate-and-Test** | Limited options, clear criteria | Huge search space, expensive testing |
| **Means-Ends Analysis** | Multi-step problems, clear goals | Simple one-step problems |
| **Backward Search** | Unique goal, complex start | Multiple valid goals |
| **Planning Strategy** | Complex with simple elements | Uniformly difficult problems |
| **Thinking Aloud** | Logical, explicit tasks | Insight, intuitive problems |

## Practical Integration

Most real-world problems benefit from **combining multiple techniques**:

**Example: Planning a Vacation**

1. **Generate-and-Test**: List possible destinations
2. **Planning Strategy**: Start with simple aspects (budget, dates)
3. **Means-Ends Analysis**: Break trip planning into sub-goals
4. **Backward Search**: Work from desired return date
5. **Research**: Look up similar trips others have taken

## Conclusion

Mastering specific problem-solving techniques expands your cognitive toolkit. While no single technique works universally, understanding when and how to apply each one—and how to combine them—dramatically improves problem-solving effectiveness. The key is recognizing problem characteristics and matching them to appropriate techniques.
