# Language Disorders: Aphasia, Autism, and Learning Disabilities

Language disorders involve the processing of linguistic information and can affect grammar, semantics, or other aspects of language. This comprehensive guide examines three major categories of language disorders: aphasia, autism, and learning disabilities.

## Aphasia: Language Disorders from Brain Damage

**Aphasia** is an impairment of language functioning caused by damage to the left hemisphere of the brain. Different types of aphasia result from damage to different brain regions, each with distinct symptoms and characteristics.

### Types of Aphasia

#### 1. Wernicke's Aphasia

**Location of Damage**: Left temporal lobe of the brain

**Primary Characteristics**:
- **Notable impairment** in understanding spoken words and sentences
- Generally **fluent** phonetic and syntactic speech
- **Semantically incoherent** speech

**Speech Patterns**:

The coherence is exhibited through:
- Creation of **neologisms** (nonsense words) for real-world concepts
- Improper substitutions of function words for content words (e.g., nouns, verbs)
- Production of sentences that have basic language structure but make no sense

**Examples of Wernicke's Aphasia Speech**:
- *"Yeah, that was the pumpkin furthest from my thoughts"* (words make sense, but not in context)
- *"The scroolish prastimer ate my spanstakes"* (neologisms—newly created words)

In the first case, the words make sense, but not in the context they are presented. In the second case, the words themselves are neologisms.

**Treatment Approach**:
Treatment for patients with this type of aphasia frequently involves:
- Supporting and encouraging **nonlanguage communication**
- Use of gestures and visual aids
- Focusing on comprehension strategies
- Multimodal communication training

#### 2. Broca's Aphasia

**Location of Damage**: Brain's premotor area, responsible in part for controlling motor commands used in speech production

**Primary Characteristics**:
- Speech containing **excess pauses and slips of tongue**
- **Trouble finding words** when talking (word-finding difficulty)
- Fails to make use of **function words** (a, the, of)
- Production of **ungrammatical sentences** (agrammatic speech)
- Problems using **syntactic information** when understanding sentences

**Speech Example**:
Instead of: *"The bicycle that the man is holding is blue"*
Broca's patient might say: *"Man... bicycle... blue"*

**Comprehension Difficulties**:

A Broca's aphasic:
- **Can understand**: *"The bicycle that the man is holding is blue"* (can use real-world knowledge—bicycles, not people, are blue)
- **Cannot understand**: *"The dog that the woman is biting is grey"* (requires syntactic processing—unusual scenario that defies typical expectations)

Because understanding the second sentence requires correctly using syntactic information, which Broca's aphasics have difficulty doing, the sentence poses problems for them.

**Key Differences from Wernicke's**:
1. Speech is **agrammatical** rather than grammatical
2. **Verbal comprehension is largely preserved** (for simple sentences)
3. Aware of their language difficulties (often frustrated)

#### 3. Global Aphasia

**Definition**: The combination of highly impaired comprehension and production of speech

**Cause**: Caused by lesions to **both Broca's and Wernicke's areas**

**Prevalence**: Aphasia following a stroke frequently involves damage to both areas. In one study, researchers found **32% of aphasias** immediately following a stroke affected both Broca's and Wernicke's areas

**Characteristics**:
- Severe impairment in all language functions
- Minimal ability to understand or produce language
- May use only a few words or syllables
- Severe functional communication limitations

#### 4. Anomic Aphasia

**Primary Symptom**: Difficulties in **naming objects and retrieving words**

**Characteristics**:
- The patient may look at an object and simply be unable to retrieve the word that corresponds to the object
- Sometimes, **specific categories** of things cannot be recalled
- For example: names of living things
- Other language functions relatively preserved

**Example**:
A patient looking at a pen might say: *"I know what that is... I use it to... you know... but I can't remember what it's called"*

### What Aphasia Teaches Us About the Brain

Diseases like Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, while tragic, tell us much about the critical functions of certain regions of the brain. Notably, their symptoms suggest that **(at least certain) phonological, syntactic, and semantic language information is stored and processed separately in the brain**.

**Key Insights**:
1. **Modular organization**: Different language components (grammar, meaning, sound) are processed in different brain regions
2. **Dissociation of functions**: You can lose one language ability while retaining others
3. **Lateralization**: Language is predominantly left-hemisphere based
4. **Plasticity**: Some recovery is possible through neuroplasticity and therapy

## Autism Spectrum Disorder

**Autism** is a developmental disorder characterised by abnormalities in **social behavior**, **language**, and **cognition**. It is biological in its origins, although the genes responsible for it have not been conclusively identified.

### Identification and Early Signs

Children with autism are typically identified by around **14 months of age**, when they fail to show expected normal patterns of interaction with others.

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Lack of eye contact
- No response to name
- Preference for solitude
- Failure to engage in joint attention
- Lack of pointing or showing behaviors
- Unusual response to sensory stimuli

### Core Characteristics

#### 1. Social Behavior Abnormalities
- Difficulty understanding social cues
- Limited or no interest in peer relationships
- Lack of spontaneous sharing of enjoyment
- Impaired theory of mind (understanding others' perspectives)
- Preference for routine and sameness

#### 2. Communication Patterns

**About half of children with autism fail to develop functional speech.**

The speech they tend to develop is characterised by **echolalia**, meaning:
- They repeat, over and over again, speech they have heard
- Sometimes the repetition occurs several hours after the original use of the words by someone else
- May be immediate (repeating right away) or delayed (repeating later)

**Other Communication Features**:
- Literal interpretation of language
- Difficulty with abstract concepts
- Problems with pragmatics (social use of language)
- Unusual prosody (rhythm and intonation)
- Limited or absent gestures

#### 3. Cognitive Abnormalities
- Variable cognitive abilities (from intellectual disability to giftedness)
- Uneven skill profiles
- Strong rote memory in some cases
- Difficulty with abstract reasoning
- Executive function challenges

#### 4. Unique Interaction Patterns

When they interact with someone, they are more likely to:
- **View their lips than their eyes**
- Avoid direct eye contact
- Focus on parts rather than wholes
- Show restricted interests
- Display repetitive movements (stimming)

### Stereotyped Patterns

Children with autism display:
- **Repetitive movements** (hand flapping, rocking, spinning)
- **Stereotyped patterns of interests and activities**
- Insistence on sameness and routine
- Intense, focused interests (often unusual topics)
- Repetitive use of objects

### Neurological Basis

Children with autism show abnormalities in many areas of the brain, including:
- **Frontal and parietal lobes**
- **Cerebellum**
- **Brainstem**
- **Corpus callosum**
- **Basal ganglia**
- **Amygdala**
- **Hippocampus**

### Historical and Epidemiological Information

**Discovery**: The disease was first identified in the middle of the twentieth century by Leo Kanner (1943)

**Gender Differences**: It is **five times more common in males than females**

**Prevalence Changes**: The incidence of diagnosed autism has increased rapidly over recent years. Autism is diagnosed today in approximately **60 out of every 10,000 children** (or about 1 in 167 children)

**Reasons for Increase**:
The increase in recent times may be a result of a number of causes, including:
- **Changes in diagnosing strategies**: Broader diagnostic criteria, better awareness
- **Environmental pollution**: Potential environmental factors under investigation
- **Better screening**: More comprehensive developmental monitoring
- **Reporting changes**: More accurate data collection

### Autism Spectrum Concept

Modern understanding recognizes autism as a **spectrum disorder**, meaning:
- Wide range of symptom severity
- Variable presentation of symptoms
- Different levels of support needed
- Includes what was previously called Asperger's Syndrome
- Recognizes individual differences and strengths

## Learning Disabilities

**Language-based learning disabilities** are problems with age-appropriate reading, spelling, and/or writing. Most people diagnosed with learning disabilities have **average to superior intelligence**.

### Key Principle

In language-based learning disability, many children with reading problems have spoken language problems. The relationship between oral language and literacy is fundamental.

### Dyslexia: The Most Common Learning Disability

#### Historical Definition

In **1968**, the World Federation of Neurologists defined dyslexia as:

> *"A disorder in children who, despite conventional classroom experience, fail to attain the language skills of reading, writing, and spelling commensurate with their intellectual abilities."*

#### What Dyslexia Is NOT

Dyslexia is **not** due to:
- Mental retardation
- Brain damage
- Lack of intelligence
- Laziness or lack of motivation
- Poor teaching

#### What Dyslexia IS

It is caused by an **impairment in the brain's ability to translate images** received from the eyes or ears into understandable language.

**Key Characteristics**:
- The severity can vary from mild to severe
- Found more often in **boys than in girls**
- The sooner dyslexia is treated, the more favorable the outcome
- However, it is **never too late** to improve language skills

### Warning Signs of Dyslexia

#### Visual Signs
1. **Letter and number reversals** (most common warning sign)
   - b/d confusion
   - p/q confusion
   - Reading "was" as "saw"
   - Writing numbers backwards

2. **Difficulty in copying** from the board or a book

3. **Coordination problems**
   - Appears uncoordinated
   - Difficulty with organized sports or games
   - Poor fine motor skills

4. **Spatial difficulties**
   - Difficulty with left and right
   - Often dominance for either hand has not been established
   - Poor sense of direction

#### Auditory Problems

Auditory problems in dyslexia encompass a variety of functions:

1. **Memory difficulties**
   - Difficulty remembering what was heard
   - Problems following multi-step directions

2. **Comprehension problems**
   - Difficulty understanding what is heard
   - Parts of words or sentences may be missed

3. **Phonological processing deficits**
   - Trouble distinguishing similar sounds
   - Difficulty rhyming
   - Problems with sound blending

4. **Word-finding difficulties**
   - Words come out sounding funny
   - May know what they want to say but have trouble finding the actual words to express their thoughts

### Types of Dyslexia

#### 1. Primary Dyslexia

**Nature**:
- A dysfunction of, rather than damage to, the left side of the brain (cerebral cortex)
- Does not change with age

**Prognosis**:
- Individuals with this type are rarely able to read above a **fourth-grade level**
- May struggle with reading, spelling, and writing as adults
- **Passed in family lines through genes (hereditary)**

#### 2. Secondary or Developmental Dyslexia

**Cause**:
- Felt to be caused by **hormonal development** during the early stages of fetal development

**Prognosis**:
- **Developmental dyslexia diminishes as the child matures**
- Better outcomes with early intervention
- More responsive to remediation

### Subtypes Based on Function

#### Visual Dyslexia
- Number and letter reversals
- Inability to write symbols in the correct sequence
- Problems with visual tracking
- Difficulty recognizing sight words

#### Auditory Dyslexia
- Difficulty with sounds of letters or groups of letters
- Sounds are perceived as jumbled or not heard correctly
- Problems with phonemic awareness
- Difficulty with sound-symbol correspondence

#### Dysgraphia
- Difficulty holding and controlling a pencil
- Problems making correct markings on paper
- Poor handwriting
- Slow writing speed
- Difficulty organizing thoughts on paper

### Impact on Development

Many subtle signs can be observed in children with dyslexia:

**Emotional Impact**:
- Frustration arising from difficulty in reading
- May become **withdrawn**
- May show signs of **depression and low self-esteem**

**Social Impact**:
- **Peer and sibling interactions can become strained**
- May be teased or bullied
- Social isolation possible

**Academic Impact**:
- May become **unmotivated**
- Develops a **dislike for school**
- **Success in school may be jeopardized** if the problem remains untreated
- Risk of school dropout

**Behavioral Signs**:
- Acting out behaviors
- Avoidance of reading tasks
- Somatic complaints (headaches, stomachaches) when reading required

## Summary and Integration

### Common Threads

Despite their differences, aphasia, autism, and learning disabilities share some common features:
- Impact on language processing
- Neurological basis
- Need for early intervention
- Benefit from specialized treatment
- Significant impact on quality of life

### Distinct Characteristics

Each disorder has unique features that require different approaches:
- **Aphasia**: Acquired disorder, typically affects adults, often due to stroke

- **Learning disabilities**: Specific difficulties with academic skills despite normal intelligence

### Treatment Principles

Regardless of the specific disorder:
- Early identification is crucial
- Individualized treatment plans are essential
- Family involvement improves outcomes
- Multi-disciplinary approach is beneficial
