# Speech Disorders: Apraxia, Dysprosody, and Dysarthria

This comprehensive guide examines three neurologically-based speech disorders that affect motor planning and execution: apraxia of speech, dysprosody, and dysarthria. These disorders differ from other speech problems in that they involve neurological impairment affecting the motor control of speech.

## Apraxia of Speech

**Apraxia of speech**, also known as **verbal apraxia** or **dyspraxia**, is a speech disorder in which a person has trouble saying what he or she wants to say correctly and consistently.

### Severity Range

The severity of apraxia of speech can range from **mild to severe**:

- **Mild**: Occasional difficulty with specific sounds or words
- **Moderate**: Consistent problems with sound sequences and word production
- **Severe**: Minimal verbal output, significant communication impairment

### Two Main Types

There are two main types of speech apraxia:
1. **Acquired apraxia of speech**
2. **Developmental apraxia of speech**

## Acquired Apraxia of Speech

### Definition and Onset

**Acquired apraxia of speech** can affect a person at **any age**, although it most typically occurs in **adults**.

**Key Characteristic**: It is caused by **damage to the parts of the brain that are involved in speaking**.

**Nature**: Involves the **loss or impairment of existing speech abilities**.

### Causes

The disorder may result from:

1. **Stroke**
   - Most common cause in adults
   - Typically affects left hemisphere
   - Sudden onset

2. **Head injury**
   - Traumatic brain injury
   - Damage to speech motor areas
   - Variable recovery

3. **Tumor**
   - Brain tumors affecting speech areas
   - Progressive symptoms possible
   - May improve after treatment

4. **Other illnesses affecting the brain**
   - Infections
   - Degenerative diseases
   - Vascular problems

### Co-occurring Conditions

Acquired apraxia of speech may occur together with:

#### 1. Dysarthria
- **Muscle weakness** affecting speech production
- Affects actual strength and coordination of speech muscles
- Results in slurred or weak speech

#### 2. Aphasia
- **Language difficulties** caused by damage to the nervous system
- Affects understanding and/or expressing language
- Distinct from motor planning problems of apraxia

**Important Distinction**:
While these conditions may co-occur, they are separate disorders:
- **Apraxia**: Motor planning problem
- **Dysarthria**: Motor execution/weakness problem
- **Aphasia**: Language processing problem

### Symptoms of Acquired Apraxia

**Primary Features**:
- Difficulty sequencing sounds correctly
- Inconsistent errors
- Awareness of errors with inability to correct them
- Effortful speech attempts
- Groping behaviors (visible struggle to position articulators)

**Secondary Features**:
- Prosodic abnormalities
- Slow speech rate
- Difficulty initiating speech
- Better automatic than volitional speech

## Developmental Apraxia of Speech (DAS)

### Definition and Prevalence

**Developmental apraxia of speech (DAS)** occurs in **children** and is **present from birth**.

**Gender Differences**: It appears to affect **more boys than girls**.

### Alternative Names

This speech disorder goes by several other names:
- **Developmental verbal apraxia**
- **Developmental verbal dyspraxia**
- **Articulatory apraxia**
- **Childhood apraxia of speech** (CAS)

### Distinction from Developmental Delay

**DAS is different** from what is known as a **developmental delay of speech**:

#### Developmental Delay of Speech
- Child follows the **"typical" path** of speech development
- Does so **more slowly than normal**
- Progresses through expected stages
- Eventually catches up with intervention

#### Developmental Apraxia of Speech
- **Atypical pattern** of development
- Specific motor planning deficit
- Does not simply "catch up" without intervention
- Requires specialized therapy

### Causes and Research

**Current Understanding**: The causes of DAS are **not yet known**.

#### Linguistic Mechanism Theory

Some scientists believe that DAS is a disorder related to:
- A child's **overall language development**
- Difficulties with linguistic rule learning
- Problems with phonological representation

#### Neurological Theory

Others believe it is a **neurological disorder** that affects:
- The brain's ability to **send the proper signals**
- Signals to **move the muscles involved in speech**

**However**: Brain imaging and other studies have **not found evidence of**:
- Specific brain lesions
- Consistent differences in brain structure in children with DAS

#### Genetic Factors

**Family Patterns**:
- Children with DAS often have **family members who have a history of**:
  - Communication disorders
  - Learning disabilities

**Implication**: This observation and recent research findings suggest that **genetic factors may play a role** in the disorder.

### Symptoms Common to Both Forms

People with **either form** of apraxia of speech may have difficulty:

#### 1. Sound and Syllable Sequencing

**Difficulty putting sounds and syllables together in the correct order** to form words:

**Examples**:
- "aminal" instead of "animal"
- "pasghetti" instead of "spaghetti"
- "hostipal" instead of "hospital"

**Characteristic**: The error pattern shows **motor planning** rather than phonological rule errors.

#### 2. Inconsistent Errors

**Tendency to make inconsistent mistakes when speaking**:

**Pattern**:
- May say a difficult word **correctly** once
- Then have **trouble repeating it** the next time
- May be able to say a particular sound **one day**
- Have **trouble with the same sound the next day**

**Clinical Significance**:
- This inconsistency is a **hallmark** of apraxia
- Distinguishes it from articulation disorders
- Indicates motor planning rather than motor execution problem

#### 3. Groping Behaviors

**Often appear to be groping for the right sound or word**:

**Visible Signs**:
- Trying different mouth positions
- Multiple attempts at words
- Visible struggle with sound production
- May try saying a word **several times before they say it correctly**

**Frustration**:
- Aware of their errors
- Frustrated by inability to self-correct
- Effortful speech attempts

#### 4. Prosody Problems

**Incorrect use of "prosody"**:

**Definition of Prosody**: The varying rhythms, stresses, and inflections of speech that are used to help express meaning.

**Manifestations**:
- Monotone speech
- Equal stress on all syllables
- Inappropriate pausing
- Unusual intonation patterns
- Robotic quality to speech

### Severity Variation

The severity of **both acquired and developmental** apraxia of speech **varies from person to person**:

#### Mild Cases
- Trouble with very few speech sounds
- Occasional word-finding difficulties
- Subtle prosodic abnormalities
- Minimal impact on communication

#### Severe Cases
- **Not able to communicate effectively**
- Very limited verbal output
- Significant frustration
- May require augmentative communication

**Range**: It can range from so mild having trouble with very few speech sounds to severe cases of being not able to communicate effectively.

## Dysprosody: The Rarest Speech Disorder

**Dysprosody** is the **rarest neurological speech disorder**.

### Definition and Characteristics

It is characterised by alterations in:

1. **Intensity**
   - Changes in loudness
   - Variable volume
   - Inappropriate stress patterns

2. **Timing of Utterance Segments**

**Result**:
**Deprive an individual's particular speech of its characteristics**:
- Loss of emotional expressiveness
- Difficulty conveying meaning through intonation
- Monotonous or unusual speech patterns
- Reduced intelligibility despite clear articulation

### Causes

The cause of dysprosody is usually **associated with neurological pathologies** such as:

1. **Brain vascular accidents** (strokes)
   - Damage to prosody control areas
   - Often right hemisphere involvement

2. **Cranioencephalic traumatisms**
   - Head injuries
   - Traumatic brain injury

- May sound "foreign" or "robotic"
- Preserved language content

## Dysarthria: Motor Speech Disorder

**Dysarthria** is a **motor speech disorder**. It is a **weakness or paralysis of speech muscles** caused by damage to the nerves and/or brain.

### Distinguishing Features

Unlike apraxia (motor planning problem), dysarthria involves:
