# MAPC Study Portal - AI Assistant Configuration
# For use with Windsurf, Cursor, or similar AI coding assistants

## 📚 Primary Instructions
**ALWAYS read first**: `./CLAUDE_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

This file contains the complete workflow, templates, and requirements.

## 📄 PDF Access Strategy

### PDFs are pre-extracted to text files
- **Location**: `./processing/extracted-text/`
- **Format**: `[Course-Name]_[Block-X]_Unit-Y.txt`
- **Example**: `MPC-001 Cognitive Psychology, Learning and Memory_Block-1_Unit-3.txt`

### To extract PDFs (one-time setup):
```bash
./scripts/extract-pdfs.sh
# OR if pdftotext unavailable:
python3 scripts/extract_all_pdfs.py
```

## 🔄 Workflow for "continue" Command

When user says **"continue"**:

1. **Read instructions**
   ```
   Read: ./CLAUDE_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
   ```

2. **Check status**
   ```
   Read: ./processing/status.json
   Identify: Next "pending" unit
   ```

3. **Load PDF content**
   ```
   Read: ./processing/extracted-text/[Course]_[Block]_Unit-X.txt
   Analyze: Structure, topics, key concepts
   ```

4. **Search for enrichment**
   ```
   Web search for:
   - Recent research (2024)
   - Wikipedia articles
   - Educational videos (MIT, Crash Course)
   - Practical applications
   ```

5. **Create MDX files**
   ```
   Follow template in CLAUDE_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
   - Sequential numbering (continue from last file number)
   - Proper frontmatter
   - Enriched content
   - Clickable PDF links
   - Mermaid diagrams
   - Self-assessments
   ```

6. **Update sidebar.js**
   ```
   Add new document IDs to appropriate section
   Use comments to separate units
   ```

7. **Update status.json**
   ```
   - Mark unit as "completed"
   - List mdx_files created
   - Update enrichment_stats
   - Increment processed count
   ```

```

**URL Encoding Reference:**
```
MPC-001: /pdfs/MPC-001%20Cognitive%20Psychology,%20Learning%20and%20Memory/

## 💡 Tips for AI Assistants

### Context Management
- Reference CLAUDE_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md frequently
- Check status.json before each unit
- Maintain consistency with existing files
- Follow established patterns

### Web Search (if available)
- Search for topic + "2024" for recent research
- Search "MIT OpenCourseWare" + topic for videos
- Search Wikipedia for foundational concepts
- Search for practical applications

### If Web Search Unavailable
- Note: "Enrichment search required but unavailable"
- Suggest user manually add resources
- Focus on creating quality structure and content

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Creating files without updating sidebar
- ❌ Using duplicate file numbers
- ❌ Forgetting to update status.json
- ❌ Missing enrichment requirements
- ❌ Not making PDF links clickable
- ❌ Skipping self-assessments or memory aids

## ✅ Success Checklist
Before marking unit complete:
- [ ] PDF text loaded and analyzed
- [ ] Topics extracted and listed
- [ ] MDX files created with sequential numbers
- [ ] Enrichment added (searches performed)
- [ ] PDF links are clickable
- [ ] Sidebar.js updated
- [ ] Status.json updated
- [ ] Files verified in browser
